      <title>Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents</title>

      <p id="_DV_M4">IEEE Standards
      documents are made available for use subject to important notices and legal
      disclaimers. These notices and disclaimers, or a reference to this page (<link target="https://standards.ieee.org/ipr/disclaimers.html"/>),
      appear in all standards and may be found under the heading “Important Notices
        and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents.”</p>

      <clause>
        <title>Notice
          and Disclaimer of Liability Concerning the Use of IEEE Standards Documents</title>

        <p>IEEE Standards documents are
        developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees
        of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) Standards Board. IEEE develops its
        standards through an accredited consensus development process, which brings
        together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the
        final product. IEEE Standards are documents developed by volunteers with
        scientific, academic, and industry-based expertise in technical working groups.
        Volunteers are not necessarily members of IEEE or IEEE SA, and participate
        without compensation from IEEE. While IEEE administers the process and
        establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process,
        IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of
          the information or the soundness of any judgments contained in its standards.</p>

        <p>IEEE makes no warranties or
        representations concerning its standards, and expressly disclaims all
        warranties, express or implied, concerning this standard, including but not
        limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
        and non-infringement. In addition, IEEE
        does not warrant or represent that the use of the material contained in its
        standards is free from patent infringement. IEEE standards documents are
          supplied “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS.”</p>

        <p>Use of an IEEE standard is wholly
        voluntary. The existence of an IEEE Standard does not imply that there are no
        other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase, market, or provide other goods
        and services related to the scope of the IEEE standard. Furthermore, the
        viewpoint expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subject to
        change brought about through developments in the state of the art and comments
          received from users of the standard.</p>

        <p>In publishing and
        making its standards available, IEEE is not suggesting or rendering
        professional or other services for, or on behalf of, any person or entity, nor
        is IEEE undertaking to perform any duty owed by any other person or entity to
        another. Any person utilizing any IEEE Standards document, should rely upon his
        or her own independent judgment in the exercise of reasonable care in any given
        circumstances or, as appropriate, seek the advice of a competent professional
          in determining the appropriateness of a given IEEE standard.</p>

        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL IEEE
        BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE NEED TO PROCURE
        SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
        INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
        CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
        IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE PUBLICATION, USE OF, OR RELIANCE UPON ANY STANDARD, EVEN
        IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH
          DAMAGE WAS FORESEEABLE.</p>

      </clause>
      <clause><title>Translations</title>

        <p>The IEEE consensus
        development process involves the review of documents in English only. In the
        event that an IEEE standard is translated, only the English version published
          by IEEE is the approved IEEE standard.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Official statements</title>

        <p>A statement, written
        or oral, that is not processed in accordance with the IEEE SA Standards Board
        Operations Manual shall not be considered or inferred to be the official
        position of IEEE or any of its committees and shall not be considered to be,
        nor be relied upon as, a formal position of IEEE. At lectures, symposia,
        seminars, or educational courses, an individual presenting information on IEEE
        standards shall make it clear that the presenter’s views should be considered
        the personal views of that individual rather than the formal position of IEEE,
          IEEE SA, the Standards Committee, or the Working Group.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Comments on standards</title>

        <p>Comments for revision of IEEE
        Standards documents are welcome from any interested party, regardless of membership
          affiliation with IEEE or IEEE SA. However, <strong>IEEE does not provide interpretations, consulting information, or advice pertaining to IEEE Standards documents</strong>.</p>

        <p>Suggestions for changes in
        documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with
        appropriate supporting comments. Since IEEE standards represent a consensus of
        concerned interests, it is important that any responses to comments and
        questions also receive the concurrence of a balance of interests. For this
        reason, IEEE and the members of its Societies and Standards Coordinating
        Committees are not able to provide an instant response to comments, or
        questions except in those cases where the matter has previously been addressed.
        For the same reason, IEEE does not respond to interpretation requests. Any
        person who would like to participate in evaluating comments or in revisions to
        an IEEE standard is welcome to join the relevant IEEE working group. You can
        indicate interest in a working group using the Interests tab in the Manage
        Profile &#x26; Interests area of the <link target="https://development.standards.ieee.org/myproject-web/public/view.html#landing">IEEE

      </clause>

      <clause><title>Laws and regulations</title>

        <p>Users of IEEE
        Standards documents should consult all applicable laws and regulations.
        Compliance with the provisions of any IEEE Standards document does not
        constitute compliance to any applicable regulatory requirements. Implementers
        of the standard are responsible for observing or referring to the applicable
        regulatory requirements. IEEE does not, by the publication of its standards,
        intend to urge action that is not in compliance with applicable laws, and these
          documents may not be construed as doing so.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Data privacy</title>

        <p>Users of IEEE Standards documents
        should evaluate the standards for considerations of data privacy and data
        ownership in the context of assessing and using the standards in compliance
          with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Copyrights</title>

        <p>IEEE draft and
        approved standards are copyrighted by IEEE under US and international copyright
        laws. They are made available by IEEE and are adopted for a wide variety of
        both public and private uses. These include both use, by reference, in laws and
        regulations, and use in private self-regulation, standardization, and the
        promotion of engineering practices and methods. By making these documents
        available for use and adoption by public authorities and private users, IEEE
          does not waive any rights in copyright to the documents.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Photocopies</title>

        <p>Subject to payment of
        the appropriate licensing fees, IEEE will grant users a limited, non-exclusive
        license to photocopy portions of any individual standard for company or
        organizational internal use or individual, non-commercial use only. To arrange
        for payment of licensing fees, please contact Copyright Clearance Center,
        Customer Service, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923 USA; +1 978 750 8400;
        https://www.copyright.com/. Permission to photocopy portions of any individual
        standard for educational classroom use can also be obtained through the
          Copyright Clearance Center.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Updating of IEEE Standards documents</title>

        <p>Users
        of IEEE Standards documents should be aware that these documents may be
        superseded at any time by the issuance of new editions or may be amended from
        time to time through the issuance of amendments, corrigenda, or errata. An
        official IEEE document at any point in time consists of the current edition of
        the document together with any amendments, corrigenda, or errata then in
          effect.</p>

        <p>Every
        IEEE standard is subjected to review at least every 10 years. When a document
        is more than 10 years old and has not undergone a revision process, it is
        reasonable to conclude that its contents, although still of some value, do not
        wholly reflect the present state of the art. Users are cautioned to check to
          determine that they have the latest edition of any IEEE standard.</p>

        <p>In
        order to determine whether a given document is the current edition and whether
        it has been amended through the issuance of amendments, corrigenda, or errata,
        visit <link target="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/collection/ieee/">IEEE
          Xplore</link> or <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/about/contact/index.html">contact IEEE</link>.<fn><p>Available at <link target="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/collection/ieee"/>.</p></fn>

          visit the IEEE SA Website.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause>
        <title>Errata</title>

        <p>Errata, if any, for all IEEE standards can be accessed on the <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/index.html">IEEE SA Website</link>.<fn><p>Available at: <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/index.html"/>.</p></fn> Search for standard number and year of approval to access the web page of the published standard. Errata links are located under the Additional Resources Details section. Errata are also available in <link target="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/collection/ieee/">IEEE Xplore</link>. Users are encouraged to periodically check for errata.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>Patents</title>

        <p>IEEE Standards are developed in compliance with the <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/materials.html">IEEE SA Patent Policy</link>.<fn><p>Available at: <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/materials.html"/>.</p></fn></p>
        <p>Attention is called to
        the possibility that implementation of this standard may require use of subject
        matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no position
        is taken by the IEEE with respect to the existence or validity of any patent
        rights in connection therewith. If a patent holder or patent applicant has
        filed a statement of assurance via an Accepted Letter of Assurance, then the
        statement is listed on the IEEE SA Website at <link target="https://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/patents.html"/>. Letters of Assurance may
        indicate whether the Submitter is willing or unwilling to grant licenses under
        patent rights without compensation or under reasonable rates, with reasonable
        terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination to
          applicants desiring to obtain such licenses.</p>

        <p>Essential Patent
        Claims may exist for which a Letter of Assurance has not been received. The
        IEEE is not responsible for identifying Essential Patent Claims for which a
        license may be required, for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or
        scope of Patents Claims, or determining whether any licensing terms or
        conditions provided in connection with submission of a Letter of Assurance, if
        any, or in any licensing agreements are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Users
        of this standard are expressly advised that determination of the validity of
        any patent rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely
        their own responsibility. Further information may be obtained from the IEEE
          Standards Association.</p>
      </clause>

      <clause><title>IMPORTANT NOTICE</title>

        <p>IEEE Standards do not
        guarantee or ensure safety, security, health, or environmental protection, or
        ensure against interference with or from other devices or networks. IEEE
        Standards development activities consider research and information presented to
        the standards development group in developing any safety recommendations. Other
        information about safety practices, changes in technology or technology implementation,
        or impact by peripheral systems also may be pertinent to safety considerations
        during implementation of the standard. Implementers and users of IEEE Standards
        documents are responsible for determining and complying with all appropriate
        safety, security, environmental, health, and interference protection practices
          and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
